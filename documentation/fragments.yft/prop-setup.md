# Prop Setup

The example prop used in this article is `prop_container_05a.yft`

### Fragment Hierarchy

</div>

### Prop Rigging

You'll also notice that each Drawable Model is rigged using a Child Of constraint instead of vertex groups.

<div align="left">

</div>

This is the case for all props. Typically each Drawable Model for a prop corresponds to a particular separable part of the Fragment. Notice there is a Drawable Model for the latch, each door, and the container itself.

### Skeleton Setup

This matches up with the bone hierarchy.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>prop_container_05a.skel</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Each bone is parented to `Prop_Container_05a` and is thus affected by that bone. Every skeleton in the game engine always has one root bone that all the other bones are parented to.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you attempt to add multiple top-level bones (bones with no parent) you will run into issues. Make sure there is a single "root" bone that all other bones are parented to!
{% endhint %}

Notice, too, that each bone has `Use Physics` enabled. This means that each of those parts will have physics in-game and will separate from each other.&#x20;

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
In this case, the doors don't actually "separate" from the mesh, but fling open instead. This is because the `Strength` bone physics property is set to -1. When set to another value (i.e. 100) you'll notice that the parts will separate.
{% endhint %}

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/FiveM_b2944_GTAProcess_tiAgH2YNzr.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>With Strength set to 100 for both doors</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

### Collisions

As mentioned before, each bone with physics enabled must have an associated collision. However, there can be multiple collisions for a single bone. Notice for this prop, there is a single collision for the latch and the doors, but the container itself is comprised of 5 box collisions.

<div align="left">

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
You will notice that a lot of vanilla collisions will use bound shapes wherever possible. This is typically preferred over using a bound mesh as it is much more performant. **Keep collisions as simple as possible.**
{% endhint %}

Each of these collision objects is linked to a bone via a Child Of Constraint.

</div>

Each collision also has its mass set in the `Object Properties > Sollumz > Physics` panel.

### Quick Note on YTYP Flags

{% hint style="info" %}
In order for physics to work for your prop in-game, make sure the YTYP archetype has the "Dynamic" flag enabled!
