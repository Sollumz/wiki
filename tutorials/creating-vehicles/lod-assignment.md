# üç¢ LOD Assignment

All models rely on LOD meshes, which greatly reduces graphics demand of detailed models and improves overall performance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
if you have any other LOD meshes ready to be set up, copy their names to the proper LOD levels.
{% endhint %}

In order to render your mesh at any distance:

1. Go to **Data** tab.
2. Scroll to **Sollumz LOD.**
3. Copy the name from High LOD to Very High, Medium and Low.
